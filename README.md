# 📊 Data Visualization for Prognostic Models

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project implements a Python program to visualize patient data trends and prognosis outcomes. It provides a clear graphical interpretation of risk scores and prognosis categories using **bar charts** and **pie charts**, making it easier to understand patient health insights. The data is simulated to demonstrate how such a visualization system might work in a clinical decision-making environment.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Matplotlib** – For creating charts and visualizations  
*(No pandas or numpy used in this version)*

---

## 🧠 Features

- Visualizes individual patient **risk scores** in a bar chart
- Shows the distribution of **prognosis outcomes** in a pie chart
- Simulates patient data without needing external files
- Prints patient data table directly in the terminal/command prompt
- Saves both graphs as PNG image files (`risk_scores.png` and `prognosis_distribution.png`)

## 📁 Files Included
prognostic_analysis.py – Main Python script

risk_scores.png – Output image of the risk score bar chart

prognosis_distribution.png – Output image of the prognosis pie chart
